    <h4>
      ACT 1 
    </h4>
    <h4>
        PROLOGUE 
      </h4>
                <P>
                    An age-old vendetta between two powerful families erupts into bloodshed.<br>
                    A group of masked Montagues risk further conflict by gatecrashing a Capulet party.<br>
                    A young lovesick Romeo Montague falls instantly in love with Juliet Capulet,<br>
                    who is due to marry her father’s choice, the County Paris.<br>
                    With the help of Juliet’s nurse, the women arrange for the couple to marry the next day,<br>
                    but Romeo’s attempt to halt a street fight leads to the death of Juliet’s own cousin,<br>
                    Tybalt, for which Romeo is banished. In a desperate attempt to be reunited with Romeo,<br>
                    Juliet follows the Friar’s plot and fakes her own death. The message fails to reach Romeo,<br>
                    and believing Juliet dead, he takes his life in her tomb.<br>
                    Juliet wakes to find Romeo’s corpse beside her and kills herself.<br>
                    The grieving family agree to end their feud.
